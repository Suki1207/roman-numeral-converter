<p>This repository contains my project completed as part of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/sukis/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification</a> from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>

<h2>Roman Numeral Converter Project</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Roman numerals are based on seven symbols and can be written using various combinations to represent Arabic numerals. This project involves building an app that converts Arabic numerals to Roman numerals.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>This project was completed following specific instructions provided by freeCodeCamp. The requirements included creating an input element for the number, a button to trigger the conversion, and a display element for the result. The app ensures that the input is a valid number within the specified range and then converts it to the correct Roman numeral format.</p>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<p>In addition to this project, I have also completed the following projects as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Palindrome Checker</li>
  <li>Telephone Number Validator</li>
  <li>Cash Register</li>
  <li>Pok√©mon Search App</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project demonstrates various aspects of JavaScript and Data Structures and was completed according to the guidelines provided by freeCodeCamp.</p>
